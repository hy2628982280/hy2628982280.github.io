<h1>Welcome</h1>
	
	<p>This is my academic website, where you can find information on my current research. I am an phD student of Computer Science and Technology in Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). I major in computer vision and deep learning. Currently, I focus on meta-learning for few-shot image generation. Prior to now, I was a master at SJTU. Before that, I obtained my bachelor degree from Shenzhen University (SZU).
