My research focuses on international conflict, particularly over the distribution of territory. I examine the effect these territorial issues have on domestic politics, with a focus at the level of the individual citizen. Here, you can find materials relevant to my published research and research in progress. 

I also provide titles for some working papers and works in progress below. I provide full links for these papers when I believe they are ready for peer review. Feel free to contact me if you are interested in some of these projects. [My CV](http://svmiller.com/cv/) contains more information about where some of these projects are in the peer review process.

I also offer [a three-page research statement](/docs/svm-research-statement.pdf) that summarizes and contextualizes my different research agendas.
